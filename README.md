# 📖 Quran Tab – Landing Page

This is a simple and fully responsive landing page for the **Quran** Tab browser extension.
The page introduces the extension, explains its features, and provides download options.
It is designed with clean UI, organized layout, and modern front-end practices.

This project is part of my front-end learning journey and was created using **HTML** and **SCSS**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5 for the page structure

- SCSS / CSS3 for styling

- Flexbox for layout

- Google Fonts (Rubik)

- CSS variables for colors, spacing, and responsive breakpoints

- Pure CSS transitions for hover effects and the FAQ accordion
